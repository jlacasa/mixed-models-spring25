## GitHub Pages 

One amazingly useful GitHub feature is [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).
It provides free static web hosting from any repository.
GH-Pages is intended to host relatively simple sites for your GitHub portfolio, project, or documentation.
Because it is free and a valuable transferable skill, this is a great option for teaching and learning.

Many organizations are using GitHub to collaboratively create and publish public workshop websites. 
For example: 

- [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/)
- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/), [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/)
- this site!

{% capture text %}Note:
There are *soft* limits and guidelines for gh-pages usage: sites should be < 1GB, use < 100GB bandwidth per month, and make < 10 builds per hour.
If your site exceeds these quotas, GitHub will send you a notice asking you to modify the repository.
All content must follow the [community guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/), e.g. no violence, obscene sex, or illegal stuff.{% endcapture %}
