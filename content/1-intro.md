## Outline for today

-   **Review on linear models**: Once we fully understand fixed linear models, it's just a matter of adding an extra assumption.\
-   **Review on variance-covariance matrices**: In essence, mixed models add an extra assumption to our very familiar linear model. Said assumption ends up storing the information about the random effects in the variance-covariance matrix (i.e., $\Sigma$ in $\mathbf{y} \sim(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma})$).\
-   **Application**: what does this all mean when we want to fit a model to our data?

## Review on linear models

One of the most popular models is the intercept-and-slope model. Why? Because it's so simple and interpretable! [It's everywere](#). Most of us learned this way of writing out the statistical model:

$$y_{i} = \beta_0 + x_{i} \beta_1 + \varepsilon_{i}, \\ \varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2),$$ where $y_{i}$ is the observed value for the $i$th observation, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is the slope parameter, and $\varepsilon_{i}$ is the difference between the observed ($y$) and the expected ($E(y_i)=\mu_i=\beta_0+x_i\beta_1$) and that's why we often call it "residual".

Statistics is all about making assumptions to get value out of our data, so let's review the assumptions we make in this model.\
- Linearity\
- Constant variance\
- Independence\
- Normality
