Welcome!  

Although preparing for this workshop is only optional, here are some points for those who just can't wait to learn more about mixed models. 

-------------

- **Install R and RStudio:** Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} using the default options, *except* when setup asks you to choose the default editor used by Git, select "Use the Nano editor by default". This will give you Git, Git Bash, and Git GUI. Git Bash is a terminal that lets you use UNIX style commands and utilities on Windows, and will be used as your default terminal when working with Jekyll.
- **Install these R packages:** Mac systems will require the "Xcode Command Line Tools" installed, so open a terminal (to find your terminal search for "terminal" in your Spotlight), type in the command `xcode-select --install`, and follow the prompts. After the install finishes, try typing `git --version`. If you want a newer version of Git, download the official [Mac git installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
