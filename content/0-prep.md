Welcome!  

Although preparing for this workshop is only optional, here are some points for those who just can't wait to learn more about mixed models. 

-------------

- **Install R and RStudio:** Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
- **Install these R packages:** We'll need `tidyverse`, `glmmTMB`, `emmeans`, and `multcomp`.
