**Dates:** 03/26, 03/28, and 03/31 $\vert$ **Time:** 3-5 pm.  

**Overview:** Linear mixed models are widely used for analyzing data generated by designed experiments. This workshop series aims to help practitioners gain understanding and develop the intuition for the most common assumptions in mixed models.

**Target audience:** K-State faculty, research scholars and graduate students interested in the applications of mixed models for modeling data generated by designed experiments. 

**Software and computer requisites:** Since model applications will be demonstrated using R software, prior experience using R software will be convenient but not required. Likewise, attendees are encouraged to bring their laptops, but will be able to follow the content regardless.

All you need to know before/during/after the workshop can be found in this website.
